1) Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types. Explain with some examples.

Types of datatypes:
1)Primitive Datatypes--it can store single values, it is default.
a)String- sequence of characters enclosed with double quotes ""/single quotes''/backticks``.
b)number- it stores all the number data types such as integer , float values etc...
c)Boolean - true/false .
d)null -empty of object
e)undefined - any variable declared but not initialized.


2) Non-primitive Datatypes-- it can store multiple values, it is user-defined. It encapsulate logic and allow to call it multiple times.
a)functions - A function in JavaScript is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.
b)arrays - An array is a special variable in JavaScript that can hold multiple values at once. These are ordered collections
c)objects -  An object in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs (also known as properties). Store multiple related data in single entity.
